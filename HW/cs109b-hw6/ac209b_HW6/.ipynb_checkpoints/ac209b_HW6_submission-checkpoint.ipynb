As we have seen in the a-section, this technique combines the content and style of two given images, and generates a third one, reflecting the elements of the original images.\n",

    "### Part A: Content loss (1 pt)\n",
    "We can generate an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another with a loss function that incorporates this information. This is achieved with two terms, one that mimics the specific ativations of a certain layer for the content image, and a second term that mimics the style. The variable to optimize in the loss function will be a generated image that aims to minimize the proposed cost. Note that to optimize this function, we will perform gradient descent __on the pixel values__, rather than on the neural network weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will load a trained neural network called VGG-16 proposed in [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), who secured the first and second place in the localisation and classification tracks of ImageNet Challenge in 2014, respectively. This network has been trained to discriminate over 1000 classes over more than a million images. We will use the activation values obtained for an image of interest to represent the content and styles. In order to do so, we will feed-forward the image of interest and observe it's activation values at the indicated layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content loss function measures how much the feature map of the generated image differs from the feature map of the source image. We will only consider a single layer to represent the contents of an image. The authors of this technique indicated they obtained better results when doing so. We denote the feature maps for layer $l$ with $a^{[l]} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_H^{[l]} \\times n_W^{[l]} \\times n_C^{[l]}}$. Parameter $n_C^{[l]}$ is the number of filters/channels in layer $l$, $n_H^{[l]}$ and $n_W^{[l]}$ are the height and width.\n",
